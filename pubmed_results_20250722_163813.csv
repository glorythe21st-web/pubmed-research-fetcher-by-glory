Small Molecule Regulation of Iron Homeostasis: Design and Optimization of Novel Iron Chelators Based on a Thiosemicarbazone Scaffold.,"Disrupted iron balance causes anemia and iron overload leading to hypoxia and systemic oxidative stress. Iron overload may arise from red blood cell disorders such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia major and primary hemochromatosis, or from treatment with multiple transfusions. These hematological disorders are characterized by constant red blood cell hemolysis and the release of iron. Hemolysis is a continuous source of reactive oxygen species whose accumulation changes the redox potential in the erythrocyte, the endothelium and other tissue causing damage to organ systems. Iron overload and its consequences can be treated with iron chelating therapy. We have carried out structural studies of small molecule ligands that were previously reported for their iron chelating ability. The chelators were analyzed using mass spectrometry, proton nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The iron chelators, 2-benzoylpyridine-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone, 3-ethyl-1-{[2-phenyl-1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene]amino}thiourea and 1-{[2-phenyl-1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene]amino}-3-(prop-2-en-1-yl)thiourea in their unbound conformation were crystallized and their structures were determined. This work addresses the evolution of a thiosemicarbazone class of iron chelators by analyzing and comparing the structure and properties of a series of closely related molecules, relating these to their",2025
Transiently acquired hemoglobin variants in patients with sickle cell disease: A case series and systematic review of the literature.,"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are transfused phenotypically-matched red blood cells (RBCs) for various indications. While screening for units that are sicklenegative is standard practice, the transfusion of RBCs containing other hemoglobin variants can be of concern to transfusion services and clinicians due to possible adverse events. Thus, this study aimed to review possible adverse events in patients with SCD with transiently acquired hemoglobin variants.",2025

To evaluate the association between healthcare provider discussion of preparedness and level of preparedness.,2025
A Comprehensive Guide to Typhoidal Anemia.,"Typhoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi, stands as a significant global health concern, with complications extending beyond the typical gastrointestinal manifestations. This review systematically examines the intricate relationship between typhoid fever and hematologic complications, collectively referred to as typhoidal anemia. Hematological abnormalities, including changes in blood profiles and bone marrow responses, are scrutinized, providing a comprehensive understanding of the disease's impact on physiological systems. Specific populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, sickle cell anemia patients, and children in resource-limited settings, reveal varied susceptibilities and outcomes. Complications, such as psoas abscess and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, are explored, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the disease. The distinct contributions of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi to anemia are elucidated, shedding light on the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Global prevalence and epidemiological variations offer valuable perspectives, underscoring the importance of regional nuances in disease manifestation. Challenges in accurate diagnosis and treatment limitations are acknowledged, emphasizing the need for continued research to enhance diagnostic precision and therapeutic strategies. Insights into long-term effects, prognosis, and the influence of host factors contribute to a holistic understanding of typhoidal anemia. The review concludes by identifying critical gaps in knowledge, advocating for ongoing research initiatives and heightened awareness campaigns. The synthesis of diverse findings provides a comprehensive overview of typhoidal anemia, underscoring the imperative of continued research and awareness for improved patient care and global public health.",2025
Oral manifestations of sickle cell disease and its effects on dental and periodontal health: A systematic review.,"Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that manifests itself in several organs. There is little consensus in the literature on oral manifestations, particularly dental and periodontal. This study aimed to identify the oral manifestations of sickle cell disease, focusing on dental and periodontal manifestations.",2025
Complement is activated in patients with acute chest syndrome caused by sickle cell disease and represents a therapeutic target.,"Despite being the first genetic disease described, sickle cell disease (SCD) continues to result in severe complications. Of these complications, acute chest syndrome (ACS), a form of acute lung injury, leads all-cause mortality. However, the pathophysiology of ACS remains incompletely understood, resulting in patients with ACS receiving only supportive measures. Here, we found that ACS is accompanied by activation of the complement pathway, an evolutionarily ancient innate immune system responsible for eliminating microbes. Using a well-defined preclinical model of SCD, hemolysis, a precursor of ACS, not only induced ACS but also drove robust complement activation. Artificial activation of complement alone similarly induced ACS, whereas genetic removal or pharmacological inhibition of complement rendered SCD mice resistant to ACS even after induction of hemolysis. These results demonstrate that complement drives ACS, establishing a link between SCD and this ancient form of immunity that provides an opportunity for targeted treatment of this complication.",2025
